## Building

On Arch Linux, install the [libxft-bgra](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/)
and [freetype2](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/freetype2/)
packages, then run `make && sudo make install`.

Below is a copy of the original README.

```
st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.
